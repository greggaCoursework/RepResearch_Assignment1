## Loading and Preprocessing the data
```{R}
setwd ("C:/Users/gregg/Desktop/R_coursework")
unzip ("repdata_data_activity.zip")
```

## Prep required packages
```{R}
library(data.table)
library(ggplot2)
library(knitr)
library(plyr)
library(lattice)

## When writing code chunks in the R markdown document, always use echo = TRUE so that someone else will be able to ## read the code. set up the global options once in the first code chunk in a document

```{R}

## variables:
## steps: Number of steps taking in a 5-minute interval (missing values are coded as NA)
## date: The date on which the measurement was taken in YYYY-MM-DD format
## interval: Identifier for the 5-minute interval in which measurement was taken
## need to make sure the date variable is converted to the date datatype
```

```{R}
activityDataSet$date <- as.Date(activityDataSet$date)

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```

```{R}

### histogram of total number of steps taken per day

      ,ylim = c(0,35),alpha=I(.6),main = "Historgram of Steps per Day",xlab = "Total # of Daily Steps"

##[1] 10766.19
median(totalNumberofStepsPerDay$steps)

##What is the average daily activity pattern?
##1.Make a time series plot(ie.type = "1") of the 5 minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across 
##all days (y-axis)
##aggregate(x,by,FUN,simplify = TRUE). x an R object, by a list of grouping elements, by which subsets are grouped by,
##FUN = a function to compute the summary stats which can be applied to all data subsets
stepsPerInterval <- aggregate(activityDataSet$steps,by = list(interval = activityDataSet$interval),FUN=mean, na.rm=TRUE)
##interval: int 0 5 10 15 20...
##x: num 1.171 0.3396 0.1321 0.1509
colnames(stepsPerInterval) <- c("interval", "steps") ##rename the columns
ggplot(stepsPerInterval, aes(x=interval, y=steps)) + geom_line(color=I("black"), size=1) + labs(title="Daily Activity Pattern", x="5 minute intervals", y="Number of steps counted")
##2.Which 5  minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset contains the maximum number of sets?
```

```{R image1}
include_graphics("C:/Users/gregg/Desktop/R_coursework/Rplot_2.jpeg")
```

```{R}
max(stepsPerInterval$steps) ##max total of steps within those intervals
##[1] 206.1698
which.max(stepsPerInterval$steps) ##this is the 104th record
##[1]104
stepsPerInterval$interval[104] ##this provides the answer, the 835th minute (interval)
##[1] 835
##Imputing missing values
##Note that there are a number of days/intervals where there are missing values (coded as NA). 
##The presence of missing days may introduce bias into some calculations or summaries of the data.
##calculate total number of missing values in the dataset
missingVals <- sum(is.na(activityDataSet$steps))
##[1] 2304
##Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset.
##The strategy does not need to be sophisticated. For example, you could use the mean/median for that day, or the mean for that 5-minute interval, etc.
##Function that calculates mean steps for a each interval. if you recall it is calling stepsperinterval which did 
##a calculation of the mean for each interval (please see above):
getMeanStepsPerInterval <- function(interval){
  stepsPerInterval[stepsPerInterval$interval==interval,"steps"]}
##make a new dataset to be which will have the NA's filled in, once the 

activityDataSetFilled <- activityDataSet ##copy our original dataset 
##Filling the missing values with the mean for a 5-minute interval that contains N/A
##Loop through each row of the dataset until we've gone through all rows (nrow)
##whereever the variable 'steps' has an NA value (is.na) call the getMeanStepsPerInterval function
##and pass 
rowcount = 0 
for (i in 1:nrow(activityDataSetFilled)) { 
  if (is.na(activityDataSetFilled[i,"steps"])) {
     activityDataSetFilled[i,"steps"] <- getMeanStepsPerInterval(activityDataSetFilled[i,"interval"])
     rowcount = rowcount + 1
  }
}

head(activityDataSet)
##and then
head(activityDataSetFilled)
##This shows the intervals that were NA now filled with the mean value
##when we run rowcount the first time it gives us:
sum(is.na(activityDataSet$steps))
##[1] 2303
##which indicates that we looped through 2303 rows
##And if we run it again it then displays:
sum(is.na(activityDataSetFilled$steps))
##[1] 0
##indicating there are no further NA entries to fill in
```

## Histogram of total of steps per day, with NA's filled with mean values
```{R}
totalStepsPerDayFilled <- aggregate(steps ~ date, activityDataSetFilled, sum)
totalStepsPerDayFilled <- data.frame(totalStepsPerDayFilled) ##convert to data frame for graphing package
hist(totalStepsPerDayFilled$steps, xlab = "Total of Steps per Day", main = "Histogram of Steps per Day")
```

```{R image2}
include_graphics("C:/Users/gregg/Desktop/R_coursework/Rplot_3.jpeg")
```

```{R}
##Now report mean and median total number of steps per day. Do these values differ from estimates from first part of the assignment?
##What is the inpact of inputting the missing data on the estimates of the total daily number of steps?
mean(totalStepsPerDayFilled$steps)
##[1] 10766.19
median(totalStepsPerDayFilled$steps)
##[1] 10766.19
##The mean stayed the same, however the median increased. This is because the mid point in our data sample has now
##shifted upwards, as the NA's were filled in.
##Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
activityDataSetFilled2 <- activityDataSetFilled
##create a vector of weekdays, this way we can create a new factor variable with 2 levels, weekend and weekday - for the given date.
weekdays <- c('Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday')
##Use `%in%` and `weekdays` to create a logical vector
activityDataSetFilled2$Day <- c('weekend', 'weekday')[(weekdays(activityDataSetFilled2$date) %in% weekdays)+1]
```

## The Pane plot showing time series of 5-minute interval and average number of steps takes, weekend versus weekdays.

```{R}
sInt = aggregate(steps ~ interval + Day, activityDataSetFilled2, mean)
xyplot(steps ~ interval | factor(Day), data = sInt, aspect = 1/2,  type = "l")
